# Live #Trump and #Hillary tweets

React/Redux app that gets live tweets using a small backend powered by socket.io and node-twitter.

## Development

For development, you need to create a config.json file in ./app/server/ with the corresponding twitter api keys.

Running the project is as simple as running `npm i && gulp`.

## Features

Used flexbox reverse order to prevent every component from updating on every new tweet, while still keeping the traditional twitter layout.
